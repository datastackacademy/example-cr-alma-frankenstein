Mr Watson, come here. I want to see you.
Can you repeat what I said please?
I’m a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don’t like something about the world, I change it.
Sometimes science is more art than science.
Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We’re all going to die. Come watch TV.
Boom! Big reveal! I turned myself into a pi~#$@e!
