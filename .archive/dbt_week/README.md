## Independent Project Overview
Before you begin, take a moment to revisit and review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Code Review: dbt
This project will let you show off what you've learned while exploring dtb this past week. You may continue to work on a repository you started earlier this week, or you can start a new repository today, but either way please include at least 8 commits representing a full day's work on Friday.

### Setup Git
1. As always, create a repository on GitHub for this project. 
1. Include a README, a `.gitignore` file, a `requirements.txt` file and at least 8 commits on Friday.

### Install Requirements
- Include whatever dependencies you need in your requirements.txt.
- Create a virtualenv, activate it, then install the dependencies in your `requirements.txt` file.

### Instructions:
This project is fairly open-ended; it's intended to demonstrate what you've learned about dbt in the past week. However, please make sure your project fulfills all the criteria below. If you weren't able to present on Thursday, please contact your teacher in writing to set up another time.


### Accepting Criteria
- Present what you learned on Thursday (5-10 minutes).

Your submitted repository should:
- Include a completed README, a requirements.txt file, a .gitignore file, at least 8 commits, and well-commented code with no unused code.
