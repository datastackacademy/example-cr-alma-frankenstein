## Independent Project Overview
Before you begin, take a moment to revisit and review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Code Review: dtb

This week, you won't be submitting a link to a GitHub repo. Instead, you'll be earning a dbt badge and showing it on your LinkedIn profile.

### Instructions
- Last week, you had time to work through [the 'Fundamentals' course created by the makers of dbt](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/take/fundamentals). Today, make sure the progress bar is 100% complete, and that you've passed all the quizzes with 100%.

- Once you do, you'll be issued a badge! You'll get an email from 'dbt Labs via Accredible'. Copy the URL at the bottom of this email.

> If you don't already have a LinkedIn profile, make a basic one today. Filling it in is one of the requirements for career services later in this course.

- On your LinkedIn profile click the button for 'Add profile section'. In the 'Recommended' dropdown, choose 'Add licenses & certifications'. Fill out the info for your badge. Skip the section for 'Credential ID'. Under 'Credential URL', paste the URL you copied from the 'dbt Labs via Accredible' email. Click 'Save'.

- In the 'Skills' section of your LinkedIn profile, add 'Fishtown Analytics dbt'. In the popup for 'Tell us where you put this skill to use', include the dbt Fundamentals now listed under 'Licenses & certificates'.

### What to Submit
- Where you'd normally submit a GitHub link to your code review, submit a link to your LinkedIn profile.

- If you're having trouble getting the badge to appear in the 'Skills' section of your profile, you can instead forward the  "Here is your credential for dbt Fundamentals" email from dbt Labs to alma@datastack.academy.
