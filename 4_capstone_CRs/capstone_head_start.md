## Independent Project Overview
Before you begin, take a moment to revisit and review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Code Review: Capstone Head Start
You have today to get your capstone project off to a good start. You may need some time for research and planning, but make sure by the code review submission deadline the project repository has:

- An informative README, with a description of the project

-  A `.gitignore` file, and a `requirements.txt` file

- At least 8 commits from today
