## Independent Project Overview
Before you begin, take a moment to revisit and review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Code Review: Portfolio

For your code review today, make your GitHub profile portfolio-ready!

Since GitHub is well-documented and user-friendly, we won't detail each instruction here. For guidance on editing your profile, scroll to the bottom of your 
landing page and click the "[Take a look at the GitHub profile guide](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile)"
link.

#### Requirements:

- [Pin](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile) the
four repositories you're most proud of.

- Create a [profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
Include a short section about yourself.

- In the profile README, write a brief (2-3 sentence) description of each of your pinned repositories. Include an image for each one.

- Upload a personal profile picture. It doesn't have to be your face, but it should be something you'd want seen by future employers.

under your picture.

- Polish an old project (or several old projects). You will be graded on having 8 commits today.
