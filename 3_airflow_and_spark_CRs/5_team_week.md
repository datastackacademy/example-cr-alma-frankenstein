## Independent Project Overview
Before you begin, take a moment to revisit and review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Code Review: Team Week
Congratulations on your first team week!

For your code review today, continue working on the project independently. If someone else hosted the repository, you'll have to make a fork. You're welcome to keep talking with your classmates, but all the work should be your own.

Suggestions:

- Fix errors

- Add a feature

- Add docstrings and type hints

- Add detail and visuals to the README

### Team Week Criteria
The code review for team week will be graded on:

- Having at least 24 commits on your team's project repository 

- Having at least 8 commits on your personal project repository 

- Participating in the presentation

Please make sure to include a link to your GitHub repository in your code review submission.
