## Independent Project Overview
Before you begin, take a moment to revisit and review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Code Review: Team Week

### Team Week Criteria
The code review for team week will be graded on:
- Your participation on your team
- Having at least 16 commits on your team's project repository 
- Participating in the presentation

If you need an exception for any of the passing criteria, please get it in writing by noon on the day of your presentation.

At the end of the week, make sure you have a copy of your team's repository on your GitHub page (you can fork it, if someone else was hosting it). On Friday, all you have to include in the code review submission is the link to your copy of the repository.
